# Image based Reconstruction: CelebA

Both G and P are still trained on FFHQ, but E was trained on CelebA (the trainset), the relevant evaluation is also done on CelebA (on the testset). The naming convention for all experiment folders are the same as for 3_0.

Folders marked with "fromnoise" are made for the noise based strategy (instead of the image based strategy): do not start with a dataset, but with images generated by our G for a number of noise vectors. We found that this method can make the loss decrease faster, but only up to a certain point (0.24 MSE), at which it stagnates and is eventually outperformed by the version that starts from a dataset. Interestingy, we do not overfit at all to the noise images (noise_input does not achieve better results than img_input in stats), possibly because we are using an "infinite" amount of generated noise. This would have been great, were it not for the fact that 0.24 is not a good value for neither training nor test. Note that we are still comparing the images, not the noise vectors.
